# GenericDecMats

This repository gives access to the generic decomposition matrices
of various groups of Lie type.

The data (in the `data` subdirectory) have been provided by Gunter Malle.

There are a GAP 4 interface (see `init.g` and the `gap` subdirectory) and a Julia interface (see the `src` subdirectory).
Currently one can just load the data and show them.
